INTRODUCTION:
The game is about the mini cricket in which there are two bats shown. One bat is the player bat which will be controlled by the user by just dragging right and left. And the other bat would be the AI bat which will respond against the user action.

IMPLEMENTATION:
Both bats have to save their wickets. The ball will move between the AI bat and Player bat. When user will hit the ball towards the AI bat, AI bat will move according to the ball direction to stop the ball hitting itâ€™s wickets, and hit it back to the player bat.
